This provides insight into how difficult it would be to perform accurate bias adjustment with lagged ground-truth data for a target outcome like COVID-19 vaccination outcomes that are expected to experience a high amount of change over a time. This indicates that future surveillance systems for such outcomes would still benefit from a mixture of online surveys and traditional data sources for calibration.
